       <h2>Shadow</h2>
       <a href="Shadow.html"> <img src="./ShadowHead.jpg" class="images" /></a>
       <p>Shadow is my older female cat.   I'm not sure exactly how old she is but she is somewhere around 15 years old.    She was a stray that came to my doorstep one rainy night and I fed her and let her go on her way.   She came back the next night and I took her in and she's been with me ever since.</p>
<br><p>I have moved several times and she's been with me, except for the time I went up to Yellowstone to work for two summers.    She stayed with some foster families while I was up there.  But she has stayed in my heart forever.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When Shadow came to me she was already spayed, so she must have come from some loving family.   I never looked around the neighborhood to find out if she belonged to someone else.  When I lived on Wedgewood and then again on Atwood I would let Shadow outdoors to run around.  She always hung out in the neighborhood and never failed to come back in.   One time however a well-intentioned stranger found her with an old set of city licenses and thought she had wandered off.   And promptly turned her in to the Humane Society.   So she spent a night in the clink and I had to pay $70.00 to get her back.</p><br>
        <p>She was so cute though, she used to wait for me to come home on Atwood, she would be lying on the driveway and whenever she saw me driving home she would get up to greet me.</p><br>
        <p>These days she is very much a lapcat and spends a large part of the day sitting on my lap whenever I sit down in my easy chair to relax.   She loves being petted and is very content, except where her feeding is concerned.   She meows at my early in the morning and at night and other special times when she wants to be fed.  I have to give her some medication before meals because she has hyperthyroidism.</p>

       <h2>Gauss</h2>
       <a href="Gauss.html"> <img src="Gauss1.JPG" class="images" /></a>
       <p>Gauss is my younger cat.   I got him from the Humane Society as a kitten when he was 12 weeks old.   He is quite a scamper and has always been one since the day I got him.   He is quite a scaredy-cat and goes prowling about at nights very cautiously.   He gets spooked quite easily and always hides whenever anybody new comes into my apartment.    He is now 5 years old and loves to chase Shadow around.</p><br>
       <p>When Gauss was the kitten pictured above he still had his claws and would use them to climb up on the backdoor screendoor way up above my head.   He would hang out there chasing bugs when I had the glass door open.   The door lets out onto my small balcony on the 2nd floor.    He used to scare me by jumping up on the railing around the balcony and falling off, down 12 feet or so.   He's done that four times and hasn't hurt himself at all, though I think it scared him the first couple of times it happened.   Fortunately I think he's got better balance finally and hasn't fallen off recently.</p><br>
       <p>He often grooms Shadow, licking her head and ears and picking stiff heairs out of her head when he is not chasing her.   He is a lot more aggressive than Shadow, who is quite docile, and doesn't know quite when Shadow has had enough of him.</p><br>
       <p>Another of his funny habits is to prowl into the bathroom, usually at nights, jump in the bathtub and scrape against the walls above the tub, all the while meowling about something or another.   I have no idea what he sees or senses there, but it keeps him fascinated.   He often prowls around during the nights wandering from one end of my small apartment to the other looking for buggies or other things that catch his attention.</p><br>
       <p>Guass is much easier to feed than Shadow.   He subsists mainly on dried food and isn't real picky about eating canned food.  I usually keep a dish of dried food filled up at his feeding station.</p>
